# Logo Generator

## Description

This application takes user input and generates a simple logo with up to 3 letters inside either a circle, triangle, or square and sets the color of the letters and shape to whatever the user wants them to be.

- My motivation for creating this project was I wanted users to be able to quickly and easily generate logos for their projects.
- The problem I am trying to solve is that it can be a time consuming hassel to create logos from scratch.

## Installation

The steps you need to take to install this project are fork the repo and clone it down to your local machine.

## Usage

To run the application you need to type 'node index.js' into the command line and then follow the propts you are given. After the propmts are finished if there are no errors then 'Generated logo.svg' will print to the command line and a logo.svg file will be created in the Develop folder. If there already is a logo.svg file then it will be replaced with the one you generate. .
